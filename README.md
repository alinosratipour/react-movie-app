# About movie App project
I embarked on this project with the goal of honing my Front-End Development skills while also gaining hands-on experience in working with React context and API integration. In this endeavor, I leveraged TVmaze to fetch information about TV shows and their associated episodes.

# How it works?

1. Users select their favourite show from the drop down list.
2. Once a show is selected it will load all related episodes into episode dropdown and also on the page with name and summary.
3. Users can also click on the show to display all information about that show like episodes and list of actors.
4. Users can also select individual episodes from the dropdown list to display information about that episode.

# How to run this project

2. open it in VScode.
3. type `npm install` in terminal.
