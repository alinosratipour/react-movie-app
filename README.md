## About movie App project

This Project was build to practice My Front-End Development Skills and also obtain new knowledge working with react context. I used
[TVmaze ](https://www.tvmaze.com) to fetch TV shows and their related episodes.


## How it works?

1. Users select their favourite show from the drop down list.
2. Once a show is selected it will load all related episodes into episode dropdown and also on the page with name and summary.
3. Users can also click on the show to display all information about that show like episodes and list of actors.
4. Users can also select individual episodes from the dropdown list to display information about that episode.
